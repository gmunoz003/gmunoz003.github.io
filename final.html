			<h3>The Coffee</h3>
			<p>Café Makarios coffee (sold under the Dominican Joe label) is grown on a 350 acre ecological reserve located high in the Central Mountain Range of the Dominican republic. The coffee is harvested using fair trade practices and is certified organic, producing a very smooth, high quality, Caribbean brew with good body, a rich cocoa flavor, and mid acidity. There are two types of coffee bean; Arabica and Robusta. Arabica is grown at a higher elevation where greater varieties of nutrients in the soil produce a higher quality, better tasting bean, and it’s the only type we sell at Dominican Joe.</p>

			<h3>Our History</h3>
			<p>The Dominican Joe concept was born in early 2005, as a partnership between
Mehul Patel (local entrepreneur) and Sharla Megilligan (founder of Makarios).
Our goal was simply to make a difference in the world. The question we faced:
could we provide Austin with a high quality coffee shop in a way that made an
impact in the world through our coffee partnership? The vision took shape in early 2006, and on
September 19th, after about 18 crazy months, we opened our doors in the heart of Austin at the corner
of South Congress and Riverside Drive. Yay us! We breathed a sigh of relief and celebrated and then
realized that was the easy part...</p>

			<h4>Our Story</h4>
			<p>Once upon a time (current day) there were Dominican and Haitian families living in poverty in the Dominican Republic, whose children had little or no access to a good education. At the same time, on the same island, there were coffee farmers growing one heck of a good coffee bean but not getting paid enough to support their families. Enter Makarios - a non-profit dedicated to helping pull families out of poverty by providing their kids with a quality education - and an idea that would help support the school and the community of farmers. What if we bought this high grade coffee (now certified by the Rainforest Alliance) directly from the farmers using fair trade practices, imported it to the US, and sold it here in order to raise money for the school? Brilliant! 

With this idea in mind, Dominican Joe Coffee Shop was birthed in Austin, Texas and Café Makarios coffee (under the Dominican Joe label) made its way into the hearts and homes of caring people all over America who want to help make a difference. It really is possible to change the world by drinking coffee!
