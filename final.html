			<h3>The Coffee</h3>
			<p>Café Makarios coffee (sold under the Dominican Joe label) is grown on a 350 acre ecological reserve located high in the Central Mountain Range of the Dominican republic. The coffee is harvested using fair trade practices and is certified organic, producing a very smooth, high quality, Caribbean brew with good body, a rich cocoa flavor, and mid acidity. There are two types of coffee bean; Arabica and Robusta. Arabica is grown at a higher elevation where greater varieties of nutrients in the soil produce a higher quality, better tasting bean, and it’s the only type we sell at Dominican Joe.</p>
